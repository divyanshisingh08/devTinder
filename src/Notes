 * 
 * GET /users: It will go through all the app.xxx("matching route") functions until it reaches the function that sends the response back. 
        The function that sends the response is called the Request Handler.
        All the functions it passes through along the way are called Middlewares.
 * 
 * 
 *  Whenever you make an API call , it goes through middleware chain and finally it goes to Request Handler (The function which is sending response back)
 * 
 * The job of express js is - to take request and send response back
